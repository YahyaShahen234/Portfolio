                fullContent: `Hello, I am Yahya Shahen. This is my Engineering Portfolio. Before we dive into my projects and work, I’d like to share a few words about myself, who I am, why I study engineering, and why I work on those projects you’ll find in the pages ahead.

                As of writing this, I am a final year Mechanical Engineering bachelor’s student in Hungary, Partnerships coordinator and Mechanical Engineer for my university’s tech lab team, and an Engineering Intern in Marmi Construction and Engineering in Doha, Qatar, where I work on-site in HVAC and MEP systems.

                To me, engineering is far more than a diploma. It is the ability to build any ambitious idea that comes to mind, whether that be for the sake of improving lives, simplifying complex works, or for the sake of art, nostalgia or curiosity. To be able to freely bring any idea of my interests to life, I need to master mechanical, electrical and software aspects of engineering, along with social aspects, communication skills and ease of finding learning sources and more soft and hard skills. This is what pushes me to keep developing myself and improving until no task is too difficult.

                My goal is to become someone people can rely on in all cases engineering and even outside of it, to be able to conquer any task at hand whether related to my field or outside it. This leads to many variations within my experiences, projects, and skills. This mindset leads to many of the projects you will see in this portfolio, in which I have chosen to show a set of my larger and more impactful projects worth noting. Some are currently still a Work in Progress, others are completed. I hope you find the joy and interest of reviewing these projects as I had, working on them.`,

There are multiple reasons behind my choice for this specific topic. Firstly, Manufacturing technologies specialization is one of my strongest suits, and the manufacturing industry is one of the most intriguing industries for me. I also find that this topic tackles a genuine problem in the manufacturing industry, which is the loss of time ,inconsistency of surface quality, and lower tool life, that arises from a constant feedrate motion, since feedrate is usually chosen by operators based on tool recommendations from the catalogue and are usually to remain constant throughout the machining process, meaning that areas in the workpiece that may allow for a potentially faster feedrate are not utilized to save time, and areas that may require a lower feedrate risk surface and tool damage.`,
                    thesisTopic: `The goal of this Thesis topic is to investigate and integrate Adaptive Control in our university CNC milling machine. The machine should be able to detect tool breakage or malfunction and make decisions based on multiple factors. The decisions may range from automatically switching to a sister tool, to stopping machining and notifying the user. The possible solutions should be coded to the G-code, and it must prove this solution can work under real conditions. Based on the deeper knowledge of programming, other optimalization questions can take into account like surface quality and tool lifetime, or feed rate, cut depth, force and vibration, etc.`,

                    abstract: "Title: \"The Fabrication of a nontoxic graphite-based battery\" Abstract: This research presents the fabrication of a novel; eco-friendly graphite-based battery; utilizing expanded graphite as the primary anode material. Expanded graphite, known for its excellent thermal stability and sealing properties, is conventionally used in applications where heat resistance is crucial. In this study, the graphite’s expanded form is repurposed to function as the anode, a role it similarly serves in lithium-ion batteries. The primary goal of this battery is to offer improved thermal stability while employing sustainable, naturally occurring materials to enhance environmental compatibility. The cathode materials under consideration include chitosan, a common waste byproduct from the fishing industry, and hematite chrome oxide. Hematite chrome oxide is positively charged, which may make it a strong candidate for cathode applications, while chitosan offers the advantage of transforming waste into useful components, thus contributing to the battery’s eco-friendly profile. The filling materials, primarily graphite powder, have been selected for their high conductivity and thermal stability. Alternative filler materials, suchs as mica, quartz, and magnetite, are also explored for their potential to enhance performance. Electrolyte options being studied include formic acid, lactic acid, and potassium iodide or Betadine. While all options present promising possibilities. This novel design is compared with conventional lithium-ion and alkaline batteries, with a particular focus on the improvements in thermal stability and environmental sustainability. While lithium-ion batteries rely heavily on finite and often hazardous materials, this new graphite-based battery seeks to mitigate such concerns by using naturally abundant and less toxic alternatives. The proposed battery’s enhanced thermal performance, combined with its focus on eco-friendliness, positions it as a promising alternative to traditional batteries, particularly in applications requiring long-term stability under extreme temperature conditions. Further research will refine material choices and optimize performance metrics, advancing the potential for sustainable energy storage solutions.",

                    category: "field and research",
                    objective: "My most recent work was in MEP, HVAC and overall construction. The goal of this internship was to diversify my applications as a mechanical engineer since the middle east, especially Qatar, where my family resides, does not have a strong industrial presence and instead focuses its engineers on Construction works. I worked as a site engineer for Marmi Engineering. I worked mainly on large tower projects but still had restaurants and showrooms in my scope. This gave me many diverse tasks, including quality control of all FCU units, inspection works for functionality of water pipes, and irrigation pumps, maintenance and testing for fire systems, measurements and CAD for comparisons between shop drawings and as-built drawings, cost analysis for other towers via site inspection to determine what is damaged and what is still pending, drafting client contracts as per QCS standard and more. I worked there for 3 months. It was a very beneficial learning experience and gave me the expertise required to work and excel in construction for countries that lack a strong industrial field.",
